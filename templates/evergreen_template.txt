 We are making Meta/Facebook/Instagram ad creative briefs for graphic designers. The ads’ contents will contain various combinations headlines, subheadlines, benefits for benefit point-outs, social proof points, product images, lifestyle images, iconography, images of the target audience using the product, images of the product in action, b-roll of products, and any other contents we list below. Attached is an image file of different visual ad creative styles with their name underneath (Reference Menu image file), please notice the way the various contents are laid out in the image, the use of color. Also attached is a CSV file for the Reference Menu of the same ad creative style names as the image, but with a proper description and content requirements per brief. Below are brand/product/angle descriptions, various content options to use based on the content requirements of the reference image. Below you will also find the exact format for each creative brief, with an example, and how it varies whether the request is for an image brief or a video brief. 

YOUR OFFICIAL TASK IS TO MAKE [{num_image_briefs} of Image briefs and {num_video_briefs} of Video Briefs] BRIEFS FOR META ADS, ALL IN 1X1 IMAGE FORMATS. FOR EACH IMAGE, SELECT 3 HEADLINE VARIANTS FROM THE HEADLINE OPTIONS BELOW. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO 1 BRIEF FOR EACH CONCEPT IN THE REFERENCE MENU, YOU CAN USE THE SAME CONCEPT MORE THAN ONCE IF YOU HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VARIATION OF IT AT YOUR CHOOSING - such as different accent visuals or types of background colors/patterns for various upcoming holidays/seasonality/use-case variations. You may repeat the same reference concept as many times as you want, as long as there is a significant difference in the visuals or headline/hook, for example focusing the headline/hook/visuals on a different benefit or a different pain point from other concepts you write. For videos, please make sure the script lines each flow organically so they read nicely, as opposed to several independent sentences in each line. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EACH OF THE BRIEFS YOU WRITE FOLLOW THE OUTPUT TEMPLATE BELOW. 

Brand info: the brand is {brand_name}, and their website is {website_url}. Their product is {product_name}. The product is for {target_audience}. The marketing angle is {tone}, {angle_and_benefits}.
