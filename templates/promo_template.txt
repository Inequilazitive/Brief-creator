YOUR OFFICIAL TASK IS TO MAKE 20 IMAGE BRIEFS FOR META ADS, BUY ONE GET ONE FREE (BOGO) OFFER, ALL IN 1X1 IMAGE FORMATS. FOR EACH IMAGE, SELECT VISUAL VARIANT SUGGESTIONS SUCH AS BACKGROUND COLOR, OR SIMPLY SAY “USE A DIFFERENT PRODUCT AND/OR LIFESTYLE VISUAL IN EACH OF THE 3 VARIANTS BUT KEEP ALL THE SAME”. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO 1 BRIEF FOR EACH CONCEPT IN THE REFERENCE MENU, YOU CAN USE THE SAME CONCEPT MORE THAN ONCE IF YOU HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VARIATION OF IT AT YOUR CHOOSING - such as different accent visuals or types of background colors/patterns for various upcoming holidays/seasonality/use-case variations. You may repeat the same reference concept as many times as you want, as long as there is a significant difference in the visuals or headline/hook, for example focusing the headline/hook/visuals on a different benefit or a different pain point from other concepts you write. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EACH OF THE 20 IMAGE BRIEFS YOU WRITE FOLLOW THE OUTPUT TEMPLATE BELOW.
